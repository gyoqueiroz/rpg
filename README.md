Simple rolling playing game created while learning Ruby

## What?
It's based on some of the basic concepts of a table Rolling Playing Game like Dangeous & Dragons.
The idea behind this project is to learn & practice Ruby language / TDD / Object Orientation while producing something meaninful (for nerds) and having fun.
Do not expect very advanced Ruby skills while looking at the code but we will get there eventually.

## The Facts
- It's comprised by a Game which has one master and 1..N players. 
- Each player has a type - or races - : Knight, Dwarf, Wizard. 
- The weapons and attacks depend on each type.
- Hierarchy is: Game -> Master -> 1..N Players
- The app is 100% cmd line based
- There's still a lot to be done

## How to contribute?
Feel free to jump in, code something and submit a PR. There's a Trello board that I will migrate to github's equivalent.
The idea is to use this as a single point for learning Ruby and share knowledge as well.


## How to play

The game is not playable yet, but you can start a game, add playes and roll dices. In order to do so first you must run the app

`ruby cmd.rb`

In order to list the available command just press Enter
